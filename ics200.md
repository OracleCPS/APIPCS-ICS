# Lab 200 - API Platfrom Cloud Service
 
## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **APIPCS/ICS Development Workshop**. 

In this lab, we will learn how to expose our ICS REST service, created in Lab 100, through the API Platform Cloud Service, enforce policies and share the documentation around our controlled service to developers.

## Objectives

- Apply Policies to API
- Publish API to gateway
- Share documentation to developers

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.
- Deployment of ICS REST service in Lab 100

## Login to your Oracle Cloud account

### Login to APIPCS Home Page

>***NOTE:*** the **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. See _Lab 100 **1.1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account_ for more information on how to sign into the APIPCS home page

### 1.1 APIs

On the APIs page you have the capability to create new API, edit or look at existing APIs. Let us explore our published ICS REST Service.

  ![](images/200/image002.png)

- **Click** on your `HelloWorldUserXX` API to drill down into the details

  ![](images/200/image003.png)

#### 1.1.1 API Implementation detail
---

Let's start with the implementation of our service:

- Let's confirm our `API Endpoint URL`, **click** on the `Edit` button, when hovering over the `API Request` policy box

  ![](images/200/image004.png)

- Confirm that the `API Endpoint URL` is set to `helloworlduserXX`

  ![](images/200/image005.png)

- Leaving the rest of fields on the defaults, and **click** `Apply`

- Next we are going to inspect the `Service Request`, **click** on the `Edit` button, when hovering over the `Service Request` policy box

  ![](images/200/image006.png)

  We have to specify the service account information for the call, in other words, the authentication for the ICS REST service. Select the predefined `ICS` service account and **click** `Apply`.

### 1.1.2 Policy Pipeline
---

#### 1.1.2.1 Key Validation

- On the right hand side, under `Available Policies`, select `Key validation 1.0` and `Apply`

  ![](images/200/image008.png)

- **Click** on the `>` icon to go to the next page, we don't need any changes on this page.

  ![](images/200/image009.png)

- On the second page of the `Apply Policy - Key Validation`, make sure to select the `Header` button and then specify `api-key` as the `Key Header`
  - We specified in this policy that a HTTP Header with name `api-key` should be in the request, set to a valid API Key. When we associate the API with an application, we will have    access to the api key as defined in the application.
  
  ![](images/200/image010.png)

- After **click** apply we a policy pipline as follow:

  ![](images/200/image011.png)

---

> Using the same steps as above, add the following policies.

---

#### 1.1.2.2 Application Rate Limiting

- Under `Available Policies` -> `Traffic Mangement` add `Application Rate Limiting | 1.0`

  ![](images/200/image012.png)

  ![](images/200/image013.png)

  ![](images/200/image014.png)

#### 1.1.2.3 Header Validation

- Under `Available Policies` -> `Interface Mangement` add `Header Validation | 1.0`

  ![](images/200/image015.png)

  ![](images/200/image016.png)

  ![](images/200/image017.png)

#### 1.1.2.4 Interface Filtering

- Under `Available Policies` -> `Interface Mangement` add `Interface Filtering | 1.0`

  ![](images/200/image018.png)

  ![](images/200/image019.png)

  ![](images/200/image020.png)

#### 1.1.2.5 Groovy Scripting

- Under `Available Policies` -> `Other` add `Groovy Script | 1.0`

  ![](images/200/image021.png)

  - Add the following 3 lines in the `Groovy Script` 


  ```groovy
    def clientHeader = context.apiRequest.getHeader("clientHeader")
    def icsHeader = context.apiRequest.getHeader("clientHeader") + "-APIPCS"
    context.serviceRequest.setHeader("icsHeader", icsHeader)
  ```

Apply the changes, by **clicking** the `Save Changes`

  ![](images/200/image024.png)

---

### 1.3 Deployment

- The next step is to deploy the API. **Click** on the `Deployments` icon, then **click** on `Deploy API`

  ![](images/200/image025.png)

- Select the target `Development Gateway` and **click** on `Deploy`

  ![](images/200/image026.png)

  ![](images/200/image027.png)

> It takes about a minute to deploy. Be patient.

  ![](images/200/image028.png)

  ### 1.4 Publication

  In the publication we are going to add some information for developers.

  - **Click** on the `Publish` icon

    ![](images/200/image029.png)

  - **Click** on the `Developer Portal API Overview` `Markdown` button

    Enter the following text, adopting it to your own API name:

```javascript
---
Welcome to my *Hello World API*
---
```

  ![](images/200/image030.png)

  - **Click** on `Documentation` `Markdown` and supply the following text:

``` 
This is an echo service hosted by ICS. 

The following headers are required:
---
api-key with a valid Application Key
clientHeader with an identifier (used to track flow through ICS)
---
Method: POST
---
Sample Payload:
{
  "greetings" : "Jack"
}
---
```

  ![](images/200/image31.png)

> This documentation will be replaced by the *Apiary* in a later lab

And the last steps are to `Save Changes` and then `Republish` the new documentation to the **Developer Portal** 

  ![](images/200/image032.png)

> If you are really curious to see the Developer's Portal - you can click on `Preview`, to open the developer's API Portal.

### 1.5 Registrations

Remember the test for a valid API Key ?  This is the place were we define the relationship between APIs and Applications.

- **Click** on Registrations

  ![](images/200/image033.png)

- Select `Hello World Application` and click on `Register`

  ![](images/200/image034.png)

  ![](images/200/image035.png)

---
  ### 1.2 Applications
---

> We are not going to create applications, but we need to capture the API key.

Open the `Applications` page

  ![](images/200/image036,png)

- **Click** on the `Hello World Application`, make a note of the `App Key` (or use the `copy` icon to copy to clipboard)

  ![](images/200/image037.png)

---
  ### 1.3 Gateways
---

The `Gateways` page gives you an overview of all the registered gateways in the environment. Gateways are the entry point for your APIs, and as you can remember when we specified your `API Endpoint URL` in the API configuration, it was in the form, *http(s)://MyGatewayIP/`suppliedvalue`*. 

![](images/200/image038.png) 

Looking at gateway where you deployed your API to and the gateway's loadbalancer, you can determine how to access the API.

> Also note that the `Download Gateway Installer` link is on this page.

Testing still needs to be done  - GET failure - Key not set - move POST policy to front - only POST allowed - track under API stats

POSTMAN / APAIRY or Swagger (OpenAPI) to test POST rest service
